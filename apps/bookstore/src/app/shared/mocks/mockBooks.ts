        'Learning Angular, Second Edition A Hands-On Guide to Angular 2 and Angular 4 Learning Angular teaches modern application development with Angular 2 and Angular 4. It begins with the basics of Angular and the technologies and techniques used throughout the book, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. The reader will next build an Angular application from scratch while learning about the primary pieces of an Angular application and see how they work together. Using lots of examples, the core parts of Angular will be introduced, such as Components, the Router, and Services. The book also covers techniques like server-side rendering and how to incrementally add Angular 2+ features to existing AngularJS applications. Finally, the reader will gain insight into advanced skills that should be part of any professional Angular developer’s toolkit such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning. Understand how Angular is organized and learn best practices for designing Angular applications Quickly build Angular templates with built-in directives that enhance the user experience Bind UI elements to your data model, so changes to your model and UI occur automatically in tandem Define custom Angular directives that extend HTML Implement zoomable images, expandable lists, and other rich UI components Implement client-side services that interact with web servers Build dynamic browser views to provide even richer user interaction Create custom services you can easily reuse Implement rich UI components as custom Angular directives Contents at a Glance Introduction What is Angular Why Use Angular Who this Book is For How to Use this Book Getting the Source Code Chapter 1: Jumping into JavaScript Setting Up a JavaScript Development Environment Defining Variables Understanding JavaScript Data Types Using Operators Implementing Looping Creating Functions Understanding Variable Scope Using JavaScript Objects Manipulating Strings Working with Arrays Adding Error Handling Chapter 2: Jumping into TypeScript Learning the Different Types Understanding Interfaces Implementing Classes Implementing Modules Understanding Functions Chapter 3: Getting Started with Angular Why Angular?

        "When developers move beyond building simple web sites or small applications, things get complicated. Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, juggling competing user interactions and integrating the work of multiple developers gets tricky. The Angular framework handles these common problems, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. Because it's popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, Angular emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient. Angular in Action teaches readers modern application development with Angular. It begins with the basics, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. Next, readers learn how to build an Angular application from scratch. Using many examples, the book teaches the core parts of Angular, such as Components, the Router, and Services. It also covers techniques like server-side rendering and incrementally adding Angular to existing Angular applications. Finally, if offers insight into advanced skills, such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",

What You Will Learn Understand the role of the Angular router and how to make the most of it Build and parse complex URLs Learn about the componentless and empty-path routes Take control of states in your application Make use of imperative navigation Understand guards and how they can benefit your applications Optimize configuration and run tests on your routing In Detail Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL. In addition, you might want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand. Doing this transparently isn't easy. The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on demand. This book is a complete description of the Angular router written by its designer. It goes far beyond a how-to-get-started guide and talks about the library in depth. The mental model, design constraints, and the subtleties of the API-everything is covered. You'll learn in detail how to use the router in your own applications. Predominantly, you'll understand the inner workings of the router and how you can configure it to work with any edge cases you come across in your sites. Throughout the book, you'll see examples from real-world use in the MailApp application. You can view the full source of this application and see how the router code works to manage the state of the application and define what is visible on screen. Reading this book will give you deep insights into why the router works the way it does and will make you an Angular router expert. Style and approach This is an extremely practical book full of code examples and descriptions to help you understand the inner workings of the Angular router.",

        'Develop smaller, lighter web apps that are simple to create and easy to test, extend, and maintain as they grow. This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps. Guided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, you’ll walk through the framework’s key features, and then build a working AngularJS app—from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. If you have JavaScript experience, you’ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app. Dive deep into Angular’s building blocks and learn how they work together Gain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC Assemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates Use AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax Communicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service Use dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design Get code samples for common problems you face in most web apps',

Get up and running quickly The first chapter opens with building your first Angular app. Within the first few minutes, you'll know enough to have an app running Lots of Sample Apps and Code When you buy ng-book, you're not buying just a book, but dozens of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter. The code is available for download, free from our website. Table of Contents Writing your first Angular web application How Angular Works Built-in Directives Forms in Angular 2 HTTP and APIs Routing Dependency Injection Data Architecture in Angular 2 Data Architecture with Observables and RxJS Data Architecture with Redux Redux and TypeScript Data Architecture with Redux Advanced Components Testing Converting an Angular 1 app to Angular Comprehensive You'll learn core Angular concepts - from how Angular works under the hood, to rich interactive components, from in-depth testing to real-world applications Best Practices Learn Angular best practices, such as: testing, code organization, and how to structure your app for performance.

I have no idea where I'd be with Angular without ng-book. You guys have made this SOOOO much easier to learn and keep up with. Thanks again..you guys are awesome!\" -- Jacob Cheriathundam \"Just finished ng-book2. I think it is the best learning material one can find about Angular today.\" -- Jegor Uglov FAQ What version does the book cover? This revision of the book covers up to angular-4.1.0. An updated version of the code is available for free at our website. Do I have to know Angular 1? Nope! We don't assume that you've used Angular 1. This book teaches Angular from the ground up. Of course, if you've used Angular 1, we'll point out common ideas (because there are many), but ng-book stands on its own Is ng-book an upgrade to ng-book 1? No. This is a completely new book and shares no content or code with ng-book 1. Angular 1 and Angular 2+ are two different frameworks and ng-book 1 and ng-book are two different books.",
